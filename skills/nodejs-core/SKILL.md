## Instructions

### Node.js contribution writing

When drafting a `nodejs/node` commit or pull request, read
[rules/commit-and-pr-guideline.md](rules/commit-and-pr-guideline.md).
Use terse subsystem-prefixed titles and plain, matter-of-fact prose. Lead with
concrete behavior, explain the reason for the change, and omit hype, canned
headings, file-by-file narration, and unsupported claims. Include the
contributor's DCO sign-off, and never add `PR-URL:` or `Reviewed-By:` — those
are added when the change lands. Validate the result with
`npx core-validate-commit --no-validate-metadata <sha>` in the `nodejs/node`
checkout.

### MANDATORY: Rebuild before testing

Node.js embeds `lib/` JavaScript files into the binary at compile time via
`js2c`. **After ANY change to `src/` or `lib/`, you MUST rebuild before
running tests.** Without a rebuild, tests run against stale code and results
are meaningless.

```
edit src/ or lib/  →  make -j$(nproc)  →  make lint  →  then test
```

Never skip the rebuild step. Never run `./node test/...` after editing
without building first.

Before starting work, **ask the user** about their build configuration
(Make vs Ninja, debug vs release, what configure flags they use). Do not
assume a specific setup. Most of the time, `./configure` has already been
run and only `make -j$(nproc)` is needed to rebuild.

### MANDATORY: Lint before every commit

Node.js runs a `Linters` CI workflow on every non-draft pull request, and on
Unix `make test` runs **no** linters. Run `make lint` before each `git
commit` — plus `make format-cpp` for C++ changes — so the lint jobs pass on
the first CI run instead of costing a force-push and another full cycle.

```
build  →  make lint  →  (C++: make format-cpp)  →  git commit -s
      →  npx core-validate-commit --no-validate-metadata HEAD
```

`make lint` does not cover every CI lint job: Python (`make lint-py`), shell
(`tools/lint-sh.mjs .`), C++ formatting, and commit-message validation are
separate jobs. See [rules/pre-commit-lint.md](rules/pre-commit-lint.md) for
the full gate, the CI-job-to-command mapping, and the merge-base form of
`format-cpp` that matches what CI checks.

Validate every commit message with `core-validate-commit`, always with
`--no-validate-metadata` — metadata validation is on by default and enforces
trailers that only exist after landing. **Never add `PR-URL:` or
`Reviewed-By:` to a commit you author**; the landing process adds them.

See [rules/build-and-test-workflow.md](rules/build-and-test-workflow.md)
for the full workflow including configure flags, lint targets, and test
commands.

### Core knowledge domains

Apply deep knowledge of Node.js internals across these domains:

- **Core architecture**: Node.js core modules and their C++ implementations, V8 GC and JIT, libuv event loop mechanics, thread pool behavior, startup/module-loading lifecycle
- **Native development**: N-API, node-addon-api, and NAN addon development; V8 C++ API handle management; memory safety; native debugging with gdb/lldb
- **Build systems**: node-gyp, gyp, ninja, make; cross-platform compilation; linker errors; dependency issues; platform-specific considerations (Windows, macOS, Linux, embedded)
- **Performance & debugging**: Event loop profiling, memory leak detection in JS and native code, CPU flame graphs, V8 optimization/deoptimization tracing

### Quick-reference debugging commands

**V8 optimization tracing:**
```bash
node --trace-opt --trace-deopt script.js
# Checkpoint: confirm no unexpected deoptimization warnings before proceeding to profiling
node --prof script.js && node --prof-process isolate-*.log > processed.txt
```

**Event loop lag detection:**
```bash
node --trace-event-categories v8,node,node.async_hooks script.js
```

**Native addon debugging (gdb):**
```bash
gdb --args node --napi-modules ./build/Release/addon.node
# Inside gdb:
run
bt        # backtrace on crash
# Checkpoint: verify backtrace shows the expected call site before applying a fix
```

**Heap snapshot for memory leaks:**
```bash
node --inspect script.js   # then open chrome://inspect, take heap snapshot
# Checkpoint: compare two consecutive heap snapshots to confirm leak growth before and after the fix; run valgrind --leak-check=full node addon_test.js to confirm no native leaks remain
```

### Node.js-specific diagnostic decision trees

**Segfault / crash in native addon:**
1. Is the crash reproducible with `node --napi-modules`? → Run `gdb`, capture `bt`
2. Does `bt` point to a V8 handle scope issue? → Check `HandleScope` / `EscapableHandleScope` usage in the addon
3. Does it point to a libuv callback? → Inspect async handle lifetime and `uv_close()` sequencing
4. No clear C++ frame? → Check for JS-side type mismatches passed into the native binding

**V8 deoptimization / performance regression:**
1. Run `--trace-opt --trace-deopt` → identify the deoptimized function and reason (e.g., "not a Smi", "wrong map")
2. Checkpoint: confirm the same function deoptimizes consistently across runs
3. Inspect hidden class transitions (`--trace-ic`) and fix property addition order or type inconsistencies
4. Re-run `--trace-opt` to confirm the function is now optimized

**Build failure (node-gyp / binding.gyp):**
1. Is it a missing header? → Verify `include_dirs` in `binding.gyp` and Node.js header installation
2. Is it a linker error? → Check `libraries` and `link_settings` entries; confirm ABI compatibility
3. Is it platform-specific? → Consult `rules/build-system.md` for Windows/macOS/Linux differences

Always consider both JavaScript-level and native-level causes, explain performance implications and trade-offs, and indicate the stability status of any experimental features discussed. Code examples should demonstrate Node.js internals patterns and be production-ready, accounting for edge cases typical developers might miss.
